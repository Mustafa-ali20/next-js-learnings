if u want to create ur own custom not found page make this exact folder name
not-found.tsx or jsx or js

// Private folder
a way to tell next js hey this folder is just for the internal stuff - dont include it in the routing system
the folder and all its subfolder are excluded from routingAdd an underscore at the start of the folder

pricvatae folder are super useful for a bunch of stuff- keeping logic ui separate from routing logiv
- Having a consistent way to organcize internal files in your project
- making it easier to group related files in your code editor 
- Avoiding potential naming confilicts with future Next.js file naming conventions

if u actually want an underscore in ur URL use %5F instead . thats just url version encoded of an underscore

// Route Groups 
(auth) wrap it in paranthesis inside it is the login, register, and forgot-password folder for better and neat structure of the files
this will treat it as organizational and exclude it fro the url the auth word in the url 

// Layouts
pages are route specific UI components
A layout is Ui that is shared Between multiple pages in your app 
like header footer sidebar nav bar etc

and if u accidenlty delete it nextjs will automatically regenerate it by its own 

// Nested Layout

// Meta data Rules and Configuting Metadata
Both ;ayout and pages can export metadata. Laypout metadata applies to all its pages, while page metadata is specific to that page
- metadata follows a top-down order starting from root level
-when metadata exists in multiple palces along a route, they merge togehter wioth page metadat overriding layout metadata for matching properties

meta data wont wont if u use "use client"
so what u have to do make a separate component

//Title Metadata

//Naviagtion
