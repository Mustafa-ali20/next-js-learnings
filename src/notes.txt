if u want to create ur own custom not found page make this exact folder name
not-found.tsx or jsx or js

// Private folder
a way to tell next js hey this folder is just for the internal stuff - dont include it in the routing system
the folder and all its subfolder are excluded from routingAdd an underscore at the start of the folder

pricvatae folder are super useful for a bunch of stuff- keeping logic ui separate from routing logiv
- Having a consistent way to organcize internal files in your project
- making it easier to group related files in your code editor 
- Avoiding potential naming confilicts with future Next.js file naming conventions

if u actually want an underscore in ur URL use %5F instead . thats just url version encoded of an underscore

// Route Groups 
(auth) wrap it in paranthesis inside it is the login, register, and forgot-password folder for better and neat structure of the files
this will treat it as organizational and exclude it fro the url the auth word in the url 

// Layouts
pages are route specific UI components
A layout is Ui that is shared Between multiple pages in your app 
like header footer sidebar nav bar etc

and if u accidenlty delete it nextjs will automatically regenerate it by its own 

// Nested Layout

// Meta data Rules and Configuting Metadata
Both ;ayout and pages can export metadata. Laypout metadata applies to all its pages, while page metadata is specific to that page
- metadata follows a top-down order starting from root level
-when metadata exists in multiple palces along a route, they merge togehter wioth page metadat overriding layout metadata for matching properties

meta data wont wont if u use "use client"
so what u have to do make a separate component

//Title Metadata

//Naviagtion

//params and searchParams
for given URL
params is a promise that resolves to an object containing dynamic route parameter (like id)

searchParams is a promise that resolves to an object containing the query parameters (like filters and sorting)
you wont be able yto acess search Params in layout.tsx

params

What it is: an object containing the dynamic route parameters (from the URL path).

Example URL: /products/123

Folder structure: app/products/[id]/page.tsx

Inside page function:

export default function Page({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  console.log(params.id); // "123"
  return <div>Product {params.id}</div>;
}


Promise confusion: Some docs say “params is a Promise” because generateMetadata or generateStaticParams functions are async, but in the actual page component params is already a normal object.

searchParams

What it is: an object containing query string parameters from the URL (everything after ?).

Example URL: /products/123?sort=price&filter=men

Inside page function:

export default function Page({ searchParams }: { searchParams: { [key: string]: string | undefined } }) {
  console.log(searchParams.sort);   // "price"
  console.log(searchParams.filter); // "men"
  return <div>Sorted by {searchParams.sort}</div>;
}


Difference from params:

params → dynamic route parts ([id])

searchParams → query string (?key=value)

🔥 TL;DR Boss
Prop	Comes from	Example
params	Dynamic route	/products/123 → {id: "123"}
searchParams	Query string	/products/123?sort=price → {sort: "price"}

Only in async functions like generateMetadata might people write params or searchParams as Promises, because you await them. But in the page function, they are normal objects.
